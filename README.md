# Simple-Comic-Scraper
This is a simple comic scraper built with Python, that you can use to download comics for local storage

Initial Commit:\
I have built the basic framework for a comic scraper, and have iteratively added features such as:\
-> Multi-threading: for faster downloads\
-> Compression: for smaller file sizes\
-> Resizing: all pages to be of uniform width for a better experience reading

Future Work:\
-> Very limited support for websites. Planning on making it more modular, so users can simply find and add their own as they wish.\
-> Very basic text based UI. May add GUI support or improve UX.
